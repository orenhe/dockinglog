Docking log
===========

What it's all about
-------------------
This simple Python code generates a human readable log of all dock-in and dock-out events from Linux syslog.

For guys/girls who carry their laptops daily to and fro the office, it may indicate the time spent there.
(IF they have a docking station. Docking stations are cool.)
